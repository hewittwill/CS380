# CS380 Project
**Author:** Will Hewitt

### Purpose
Set of notebooks for Will Hewitt's CS380 project at The University of Auckland. Can be used to train a UNet model 
to segment echocardiography frames from the CAMUS dataset.

### Audience
This is meant for anyone in the RnD side. Meant as a playground for identifying which model would work best. 
Specifically here, identify which ensemble model would work best
### Conda Environment
No special packages. Select the `heartlab` env from Kernel dropdown for the heartlab env.
### Data Sources
This project uses the CAMUS dataset, but can be edited to use any. Data located at `data/camus/v1/`.
